# Data Modelling Course Materials 

This repository contains code and analysis performed for my DATA MODELING graduate course at Harvard University. The files are presented in both R Markdown (.rmd) and PDF formats for comprehensive documentation and readability.

## Repository Structure

	•	/code/: Contains R Markdown files (.rmd) used for various data modeling assignments and projects.
	•	/output/: Contains the rendered PDF versions of the .rmd files for easy viewing of code and results.
 	•	/data/: Contains the data that was provided outside of the existing libraries mentioned in the .rmd files.

## Course Overview

The course focuses on:
	•	Building and analyzing statistical models using R.
	•	Applying techniques such as regression, ANOVA, and data visualization.
	•	Understanding and interpreting model diagnostics and results.

## Contents

Key Topics Covered:

	•	Linear Regression Analysis: Modeling relationships between variables.
	•	ANOVA: Analysis of variance for hypothesis testing.
	•	Residual Analysis: Evaluating model fit through residuals and plots.
	•	Regularization Techniques: Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net.
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visual and statistical exploration of data.

Example Files:

	•	linear_model_analysis.rmd & linear_model_analysis.pdf: Code and report for linear model building.
	•	anova_project.rmd & anova_project.pdf: Analysis of variance project and findings.

## Prerequisites

To run the .rmd files locally, ensure you have:
	•	R installed (version X.X or higher)
	•	RStudio for easy editing and rendering of .rmd files
	•	Required R packages: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyverse, etc.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash 
   git clone https://github.com/break/datamod.git
2.	Open and run .rmd files in RStudio to reproduce the analysis.

3.	View PDF reports for a snapshot of the analysis and results.
